Our research accurately distinguished between malignant and benign Melanoma using the ISIC 2020 data set. As a result of the lack of prior research, we employ a morphological preprocessing technique to remove noise from the dataset. To balance the dataset, we utilized random undersampling in the majority (benign) class and photometric augmentation in the minority (malignant) class. We propose 
a shallow CNN architecture to classify malignant and benignÂ Melanoma and attained an excellent test accuracy of 98.82%.
